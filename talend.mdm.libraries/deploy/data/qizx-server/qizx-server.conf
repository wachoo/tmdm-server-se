## User and Role for Qizx server administration
 # Administration tasks such as stopping/starting the Qizx engine, creating and
 # destroying XML Libraries, etc (requests described as 'administration requests'), 
 # is restricted to privileged users.
 # - An admin user can be defined in property 'admin_user' (several names
 #   may appear there).
 # - Alternatively, this privilege can be based on roles: property 'admin_role'
 #   specifies a role allowed to administrate this server.
 # If both properties are void, administration requests are allowed from any user.
 #
 # NB: roles and users are managed in the WebApp or Servlet container configuration.

## POST Request size limit in Mb (caution: could be overridden by server config)

## AccessControl class used by the Qizx engine (full Java class name)
 # must be accessible to the class loader.
 # Note that support for requests setacl / getacl is provided only for
 # default class ACLAccessControl.
## DISABLED by default

## Size of the Sequence Cache: 
 # value could be approximately the number of simultaneous users

## Whether the Sequence Cache is invalidated by looking at the XQuery expressions
 # (smart = true) or systematically cleared on any update (smart = false)
 # default is 'smart'

## Memory size in Mb allocated to the XML Library engine for caches etc.
 # A minimum size of 100 Mb is recommended
 # if undefined or negative, the engine takes automatically about 40% of the
 # maximal memory available.

## FullTextFactory class used by the Qizx engine (full Java class name)

## XML schema and DTD catalogs for XML parsing in the server. 
 # Uses Apache Resolver: see  http://xml.apache.org/commons/components/resolver/ 
 # - catalogs: a list of paths containing XML catalogs, absolute or relative
 #   to this configuration file, separated by semicolons.
 # - catalogs_verbosity: an integer from 0 to 9, for debugging.
